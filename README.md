# Mastermind_Game
Mastermind Program I made that gets progressively harder each level
How to play:
1: Select a diffuculty just by typing in the number
2: You will be given what level your on and a set of letters which you have to put in order
3: Once you put in your order of letters you will see x's and o's on the bottom saying what letter is in the wrong place and what letters are in the right place.
4: Once you get the order you will level up and get more lteters that you have to put in order.
%: Keep playing until you can't win(becuase you only have 5 tries on easy)
